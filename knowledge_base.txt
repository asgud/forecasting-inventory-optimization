PROJECT: SUPPLY CHAIN FORECASTING & INVENTORY OPTIMIZATION
==============================================================================

OVERVIEW:
- Dataset: DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset
- Records: 75,564 orders
- Time Period: 145 weeks (2015-2017)
- Total Products: 87
- Focus: AX products (high value, stable demand)

==============================================================================
METHODOLOGY
==============================================================================

Step 1: Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and invalid records
- Handled missing values
- Converted date columns to proper format
- Final clean dataset: 75,564 orders

Step 2: ABC-XYZ Analysis
- ABC: Categorized products by revenue contribution
  - A: Top products (80% revenue)
  - B: Medium products (15% revenue)
  - C: Low products (5% revenue)
- XYZ: Categorized by demand variability (Coefficient of Variation)
  - X: Stable demand (CV < 0.25)
  - Y: Moderate variability (0.25 < CV < 0.5)
  - Z: High variability (CV > 0.5)
- Combined into segments: AX, AY, AZ, BX, BY, BZ, CX, CY, CZ

Step 3: Demand Forecasting
- Analyzed data patterns before model selection
- Tested 3 models: Naive, Moving Average (4), Simple Exponential Smoothing
- Selected SES (alpha=0.6) as best model

Step 4: Inventory Optimization
- Calculated Safety Stock and Reorder Point for AX products
- Used 99% service level (Z-score = 2.33)
- Formula: Safety Stock = Z × Std Dev × √(Lead Time)
- Formula: Reorder Point = (Avg Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

MODEL SELECTION JUSTIFICATION
==============================================================================

WHY SIMPLE EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING (SES) OVER ML MODELS?

Data Pattern Analysis Results:
- Coefficient of Variation (CV): 11.1% → Low variability
- Trend: Slope = -0.61 → Essentially flat, no trend
- Seasonality: 9.8% variation → Weak seasonality

Model Comparison Results:
| Model              | MAE (units) | MAPE (%) |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| Naive              | 100         | 19.06    |
| Moving Average (4) | 97          | 19.39    |
| SES (α=0.6)        | 94          | 18.75    | ← Winner

Conclusion: With stable, non-seasonal data, simple models perform as well as 
complex ML models. SES was chosen because it:
- Achieved lowest MAPE (18.75%)
- Balances reactivity with stability
- Is computationally efficient
- Easy to interpret and maintain

INVENTORY PARAMETERS
==============================================================================

Service Level Strategy:
- AX products: 99% service level (Z = 2.33) → High priority, cannot afford stockout
- BX products: 95% service level (Z = 1.65) → Automated reorder
- CY/CZ products: 90% service level (Z = 1.28) → Minimal stock

Average Lead Time: 3.48 days (0.50 weeks)

Order Calculation Method: Order Up-To Level
- Target Stock = (Avg Weekly Demand × Weeks of Supply) + Safety Stock
- Order Quantity = Target Stock - Current Stock

==============================================================================
LEAD TIME CALCULATION
==============================================================================

Source: "Days for shipping (real)" column from raw data
- This represents actual delivery time, not scheduled/planned time

Lead Time Statistics:
- Mean: 3.48 days (0.50 weeks)
- Min: 0 days
- Max: 6 days

Calculation Method:
- Overall average used: df['Days for shipping (real)'].mean() = 3.48 days
- Also calculated per product for more accuracy

Lead Time per AX Product:
| Product                                    | Lead Time (days) |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Field & Stream Sportsman 16 Gun Fire Safe  | 3.51             |
| Perfect Fitness Perfect Rip Deck           | 3.50             |
| Diamondback Women's Serene Classic Comfort | 3.46             |
| Nike Men's Free 5.0+ Running Shoe          | 3.47             |
| Nike Men's Dri-FIT Victory Golf Polo       | 3.48             |
| Pelican Sunstream 100 Kayak                | 3.45             |

Note: Lead times are very consistent across products (~3.5 days), 
so using average lead time is reasonable for this dataset.

Why "Real" vs "Scheduled":
- "Days for shipping (real)" = Actual historical performance
- "Days for shipment (scheduled)" = What was planned
- Used "real" because it reflects actual delivery performance

==============================================================================
PROJECT LIMITATIONS
==============================================================================

1. Single Variable Model: Only uses historical demand, doesn't account for 
   price changes, promotions, or external factors

2. Static Lead Time: Uses average lead time (3.48 days), doesn't account for 
   supplier variability

3. Historical Data Only: No real-time inventory tracking

4. Limited Scope: Only covers 6 AX products (though they represent 74% revenue)

Future Improvements:
- Add ML models with external features (price, promotions, weather)
- Incorporate dynamic lead time predictions
- Extend analysis to BX and CY segments
- Connect to real-time inventory system
